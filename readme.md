Basic [Three.js][1] Intro

Initially, this is simply the 20-line or so cube rotation demo lifted from [Mr.Doob][mrdoob]'s [Three.js documentation][2].

For travellers and my own good, I have taken to annotating his efforts in order that we may better understand this masterpiece.

Hopefully, this will serve as the acorn which produces somebody's epic, 3D, Oak!

Cheers
